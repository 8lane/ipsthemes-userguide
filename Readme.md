# Theme Settings
The available theme settings in IPS4 allow for incredible levels of personalization and customization potential. However, we don't just settle for the defaults. We have gone one step further and extended the setting functionality to create our own. This section covers what's available in our bespoke framework.

## General
#### Name
This is the name as it appears in the theme chooser menu. Change this to whatever you like.
#### Parent
This will make the theme a "child" of another theme. It will inherit any customized HTML or CSS.
> __TIP:__ Want to customize your purchased theme? To avoid losing changes on upgrades, we suggest installing the theme twice and then use the "child" theme as your main theme.

#### Default theme?
Make this the default theme in your IPS Community Suite.
#### Available for
Choose which groups have access to the theme via the theme chooser.

## Logos

#### Sharer Logo Image
This image is used when sharing links to Facebook.
#### Favicon Image
This is a little image that appears in the browser's address bar. The file format should be in .ICO.

## Customization
This section includes information on how to customize & further extend our themes.

#### Child themes
To avoid losing your edits when installing newer versions of the theme, we recommend that you make your customizations on a child theme.

* __Step 1:__ Install the theme as usual.
* __Step 2:__ Go to the "Customization" section within your forum's ACP.
* __Step 3:__ Click the "+ Add Theme" button,  select the "Manual Mode" option and then click "Next".
* __Step 4:__ Fill out the details of your new theme.
* __Step 5:__ Under the "Parent" option, make sure you select the pre-installed theme from step 1.

#### Adding CSS
Rather than editing our own CSS, it's simpler to create your own. This means that when you upgrade, your newly created CSS files will remain intact and not be overwritten by the update.
> __TIP:__ Add your CSS file to directory: "css/core/front/custom"

#### Upgrades
When we release an update to a theme, you should download and apply this update to the __parent__ theme. Your customized child theme will then inherit any updated templates. Your own CSS files and settings will be left intact. __Always make a backup first!__
